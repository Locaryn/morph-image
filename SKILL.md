# Image Generation Skill

Use the plugin MCP tools rather than application commands:

- `list_image_models` lists installed diffusion checkpoints.
- `install_image_model` downloads a checkpoint and its required companions from HuggingFace.
- `generate_image` renders locally through the extension's stable-diffusion.cpp process.

For `generate_image`, provide:

- `prompt`: detailed visual description;
- `model` when a specific installed checkpoint is requested; omit it to follow the account's default image model, falling back to the first installed checkpoint;
- `width` / `height`: a value between 64 and 2048;
- `steps` and `cfg_scale` when the user asks for custom sampling;
- `input_image` as a `data:image/...;base64,...` URL for image-to-image editing;
- `variants` between 1 and 8 when several alternatives are useful.

The extension owns the Marketplace image filters, catalogue, download sources,
VAE/text-encoder plans, process invocation, output files and its model-agnostic
Studio interface. Locaryn only renders and validates the generic catalogue data;
it does not embed image-model sources, an image engine, image-generation command
or image button in the chat composer. The host renders MCP image artifacts
returned by this extension directly in the conversation.
